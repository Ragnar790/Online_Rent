# Cloning and Running the Application in local

Clone the project into local

 Install all the npm packages. In the terminal go to the project directory and type the following command to install all the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Typing this command should start the server (Assuming you have `nodemon` installed globally)

```bash
npm start
```
The server runs on port 8080.
